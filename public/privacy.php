          <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>Last updated: 8/22/2023</p>
          <p id="i0t5">Welcome to the <?php echo $settings->pageTitle; ?> website (<span class="red-text">https://<?php echo $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']; ?> or the "Website"). This written
            policy (the "Privacy Policy") is designed to tell you about our practices regarding collection, use, and
            disclosure of information that you may provide via this Website and certain related services. Please be sure
            to read this entire Privacy Policy before using, or submitting information, to this Website.</span></p>
          <h4>POLICY</h4>
          <p>The policy of the Website is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. To fulfill this policy, the
            Website agrees to exercise the precautions set forth in this Privacy Policy to maintain the confidentiality
            of information provided by you in connection with accessing and using the Website.</p>
          <h4>YOUR CONSENT</h4>
          <p>This Privacy Policy sets forth the Website's current policies and practices with respect to nonpublic
            personal information of the users of the Website. By using this Website, you agree with the terms of this
            Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via this Website, you consent to the collection, use, and
            disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h4>OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h4>
          <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. This Website is not intended for people
            under the age of 18. We never collect or maintain information at the Website from persons we know to be
            under age 18, and no part of our Website is designed to attract anyone under age 18. We encourage parents to
            talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose to websites.</p>
          <h4>ACTIVE INFORMATION COLLECTION</h4>
          <p>Like many websites, this Website actively collects information from its visitors both by asking you specific
            questions and by permitting you to communicate directly with us via e-mail and/or feedback forms. Some of
            the information that you submit may be personally identifiable information (that is, information that can be
            uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number and
            sales delivery, billing and credit card information). Some areas of this Website may require you to submit
            information in order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions,
            tips/pointers, order processing) or to participate in a particular activity (such as other promotions). You
            will be informed at each information collection point what information is required and what information is
            optional.</p>
          <h4>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h4>
          <p>Except as otherwise stated, we may use your information to improve the content of our Website, customize the
            Website to your preferences, communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for our marketing
            and research purposes, and for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. If you provide personally
            identifiable information to this Website, we may combine such information with other actively collected
            information unless we specify otherwise at the point of collection. We may combine your personally
            identifiable information with passively collected information.</p>
          <p>Remember that the information provided by this site is for general background purposes and is not intended to
            be used in connection with, or as a substitute for, medical diagnosis or treatment by a trained
            professional. You should always consult your own physician about any healthcare questions you may have,
            especially before trying a new medication, diet, fitness program, or approach to health care issues.</p>
          <h4>CREDIT CARD SECURITY</h4>
          <p>Company may, in certain instances, collect credit card numbers, bank account information and related
            information when an individual places an order on Company's Website. When the credit card or bank account
            information is submitted to Company, such information encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption
            software. Company will use the credit card information or bank account information for purposes of
            processing and completing the transaction you requested on the Website.</p>
          <p>We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. We do not share, trade, or sell credit card
            information to any 3rd party. Your credit card information is not retained as the result of any of these
            processes. Your payment and personal information is always safe. Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is
            the industry standard and among the best software available today for securing commercial transactions. It
            encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address so that it cannot
            be read over the internet.</p>
          <h4 id="i09jg">OPT-OUT PROCEDURES</h4>
          <p id="iylds">You may always opt-out of receiving communications from us. To not receive future e-mail communications from
            <?php echo $settings->pageTitle; ?>, please send an email with "Remove" in the subject line to <a draggable="true" data-highlightable="1" href="mailto: <?php echo $settings->email; ?>" id="irsot-2"><?php echo $settings->email; ?></a> or
            contact us by phone at <a href="tel: <?php echo $settings->phone; ?>" class="link"><?php echo $settings->phone; ?></a>. Support Hours: 24 / 7 Monday - Sunday.</p>
          <h4>SECURITY OF INFORMATION</h4>
          <p>You can be assured that personal information collected through the Website is secure and is maintained in a
            manner consistent with current industry standards. The importance of security for all personal information
            associated with our subscribers is of utmost concern to us. Your personal information is protected in
            several ways. Your personal information resides on a secure server that only selected employees and
            contractors have access to via password. In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions
            and order fulfillment are handled by established third-party banking, processing agents and distribution
            institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment
            information and to process and ship your order.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100%
            secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there
            are security and privacy limitations of the internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security,
            integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Website
            cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a
            third party. Moreover, where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features on this
            Website, it is your responsibility to safeguard them.</p>
          <h4>PASSIVE INFORMATION COLLECTION</h4>
          <p>As you navigate through a website, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without
            you actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol
            addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collection.</p>
          <p>This Website may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by
            your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be
            non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time
            you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). We use your IP
            address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for
            your computer to use in connecting to our Website, and administer and improve services to our consumers.</p>
          <p>A "cookie" is a bit of information that a website sends to your web browser that helps the site remember
            information about you and your preferences.</p>
          <p>"Session cookies" are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser window or
            otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies are used to improve navigation on websites and to collect
            aggregate statistical information. This Website uses session cookies.</p>
          <p>"Persistent cookies" are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your
            computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer
            for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (e.g.,
            username), helping to determine what areas of the website visitors find most valuable, and customizing the
            website based on your preferences. This Website uses persistent cookies.</p>
          <p>"Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller
            than cookies and tell the website server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the
            visitor's computer. This Website uses Internet tags. "Navigational data" ("log files," "server logs," and
            "clickstream" data) and "Internet Tags" are used for system management, to improve the content of the site,
            market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors. This Website uses navigational data. </p>
          <h4>LINKS</h4>
          <p>This Website may contain links to websites of third parties not affiliated with <?php echo $settings->pageTitle; ?>. This
            Privacy Policy will not apply to these third-party websites and the Website is not responsible for the
            privacy practices or the content on any of these other websites, even where these third-party sites indicate
            a special relationship or "partnership" with the Website. We do not disclose personally identifiable
            information to those responsible for the linked sites. The linked sites, however, may collect personal
            information from you when you link to their site. This collecting of information is not subject to the
            control of the Website. To ensure protection of your privacy, always review the privacy policies of the
            sites you visit by linking from this Website.</p>
          <h4>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
          <p>This Privacy Policy may change over time. We will notify you by e-mail to the e-mail address associated with
            your account whenever we make any substantive changes to this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the
            changed version (for example, if you do not approve of a different way that we intend to use personal
            information) you may let us know by letter or e-mail. If you do not respond with any objections, we will
            assume that you consent to changes in the Privacy Policy. Changes will not apply retroactively to personal
            information that was collected before the changes to the Privacy Policy, except as may be required by law. </p>
