2. **Sign Carrier Partnerships**: Once you’ve finished your contracting steps, if nothing is missing, you will receive signature requests to partner with our insurance carriers.

3. **Begin Training**: While the carriers are processing your paperwork, you can use this time to make sure you are ready to help insure families by preparing with our free training resources!
